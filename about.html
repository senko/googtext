    <h1>What is this stuff</h1>

    <p class="note">
        <b>What is it?</b><br />
        Googtext is a small service that allows you to upload a gettext .PO file
        (file describing strings in application and their translations in particular
        language), and asks Google to translate it. Returned translations are then
        saved to a new .PO file which you can download.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
        <b>Is it any good?</b><br />
        Compared to <em>any</em> human translator, <b>NO</b>. This kind of hacked-up out-of-context
        automated translation will hapilly produce utter nonsense. It is, however, good
        to start with. I think it's easier to fix existing bad translation than start
        from scratch.

    <p class="note">
        <b>How does it work?</b><br />
        A PHP script takes care of file uploading. Once it's on the server, a command-line
        Python program is called, which parses the .PO file, takes out the original strings
        and passes them to <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/">Google
        Language API</a> in batch mode, in several requests (101 strings per request). The
        translated strings are inserted into .PO file as translations, and the file is saved
        and downloaded. The entire process uses and produces UTF-8 encoded files.

    <p class="note">
        <b>Show me the source!</b><br />
        You can grab the source <a href="googtext.tgz">here</a>. The PHP script, Python
        <code>googtext</code> program and <code>python-google-translate</code> module
        are under Public Domain, and you may use them as you see fit. To run this, you'll
        need a recent Python installation (I'm using 2.5) with <a
        href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-json/">python-json</a> (included in
        Python 2.6) and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/polib/">polib</a> modules.
        You may also want to get Google API key if you plan to use this heavily.
