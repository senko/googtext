* If you're on Python2.4 or Python2.5, you might
  want to use provided json.py instead of python-json
  package. Bundled version has a small oneliner fix in
  unicode handling (run a diff against your system
  version to find it).

* Bundled polib.py is from http://code.google.com/p/polib/
  and is under MIT license.

* PHP and Python parts: gtranslate.py, googtext.py and
  upload.php are in Public Domain. I still plan to maintain
  the gtranslate module though, so if you want to use
  it in other projects, you might want to check my
  site for updates/fixes, or if you have some,
  contribute back.

* Please change referer and API key to values applicable
  to your use. They are used by Google to identify/contact
  you if needed (e.g. app misbehaving, etc). If my
  contact info is there and they ask me about your site,
  I won't be able to help.
