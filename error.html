    <p class="note">
        Something went very wrong while trying to process your .PO file
        and get the translation from Google. I'm just a poor little
        script and can easily get confused :-(
    </p>
    <p class="note">
        Please check that you uploaded the correct file and specified
        the correct source and target languages, and try again. If the
        problem persists, either I don't understand your PO file or
        Google decided that it doesn't like me.
